NAME
    Konstrukt - Web application/design framework

SYNOPSIS
    use Konstrukt;

DESCRIPTION
    The basic idea (which is not new) is to compose each page with the aid
    of special tags that offer functionalities beyond the plain markup of
    HTML.

    The tags are used to structure the pages and the content, add dynamics
    to your website and encapsulate complex applications and common
    functionalities in plugins, which can very easily be integrated in your
    website. Additionally strict separation of code, content and layout is
    maintained.

    Covered functionalitys include:

    * A powerful templating system
    * Blog
    * Wiki
    * Calendar
    * Guestbook
    * Embedded Perl
    * and much more...

    You may build powerful web sites in an instant and have full control
    over the look and feel through the template system.

    You may also nest (and thus combine) the tags/plugins into each other,
    which makes it a very powerful but still easy to use system.

  Further information
    For more in-depth information you may want to take a look at
    Konstrukt::Doc and the docs/ directory in this package.

    There you will find information on the usage of this framework and on
    plugin development as well as on the framework internals.
