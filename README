NAME
    Konstrukt - Web application/design framework

SYNOPSIS
    use Konstrukt;

DESCRIPTION
    This framework aims (beside others) for separation of presentation,
    logic and content.

    The presentation is basically accomplished with a very powerful
    templating system, which allows fine grained modularization of the
    presentation components (templates can be nested as deep as you want)
    and has an easy to use interface, that any non-programmer will
    understand.

    The logic is encapsulated in plugins, which can be integrated seamlessly
    into the websites using a simple tag-interface. You can develop your own
    plugins easily and also use the existing plugins for your own ones
    through the perl-interface of the existing plugins. The Konstrukt core
    will do all the nasty donkeywork for you, so you can concentrate on the
    logic of your application.

    The content for each application-plugin is stored in a database using
    perl DBI. The data backends for each plugin are implemented as a
    separate plugin, which can be exchanged easily, so the applications can
    adapt to various data stores. Static content (layout, static web pages,
    ...) will be stored in modular templates.

    Your web pages will only describe what they contain, not how they are
    generated. They will be as simple as:

            <!-- use a template for the page layout, set the page title to "blog"
                 and use the blog plugin as the content -->
        
            <& template src="/templates/layout.template" title="blog" &>
                    <$ content $>
                            <& blog / &>
                    <$ / $>
            <& / &>
