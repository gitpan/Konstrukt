<p>Konstrukt::Doc::About - About the Konstrukt framework</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The basic idea (which is not new) is to compose each page with the aid of special tags that offer functionalities beyond the plain markup of HTML.</p>

<p>The tags are used to structure the pages and the content,
add dynamics to your website and encapsulate complex applications and common functionalities in plugins,
which can very easily be integrated in your website.
Additionally strict separation of code,
content and layout is maintained.</p>

<p>Covered functionalitys include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A powerful templating system</li>

<li>Blog</li>

<li>Wiki</li>

<li>Calendar</li>

<li>Guestbook</li>

<li>Embedded Perl</li>

<li>and much more...</li>
</ul>

<p>You may build powerful web sites in an instant and have full control over the look and feel through the template system.</p>

<p>You may also nest (and thus combine) the tags/plugins into each other,
which makes it a very powerful but still easy to use system.</p>

<p>This framework has these main goals:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="1._Rapid_development"
>1.
Rapid development
<dt><a name="2._Separation_of_code,_content_and_layout"
>2.
Separation of code,
content and layout
<dt><a name="3._Reuse_of_code/markup"
>3.
Reuse of code/markup
<dt><a name="4._Clean_code"
>4.
Clean code
<dt><a name="5._Speed"
>5.
Speed</a></dt>
</dl>

<p>These goals are accomplished by the following techniques:</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="1._Rapid_development"
>1.
Rapid development</a></h2>

<p>As this framework supposes heavy use of templating,
you&#39;ll usually never write markup twice.
The templates can be easily nested into each other which allows for high modularity and reuse even at the markup level.</p>

<p>Additionally there already exists a wide range of tags/plugins,
which offer commonly used functionality like blogs or wikis.</p>

<p>If you want to develop an application that&#39;s not yet covered by the supplied plugins,
you can develop your own ones &#34;easily&#34; (ok,
you cannot just hack away on it,
you have to read a bit before).
The framework supports your plugin development with an existing infrastructure of session and user management,
debug facilities,
settings handling and request/response-objects.
So you don&#39;t have to do this nasty work.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="2._Separation_of_code,_content_and_layout"
>2.
Separation of code,
content and layout</a></h2>

<p>The logic is usually implemented in the plugins (which will be used as tags from the markup).
You won&#39;t write any markup in your plugins,
instead your plugins pass all data to templates,
which will display your data and allow the user to interact with your plugin.</p>

<p>Thus all markup will be inside the templates,
which only consist of markup (html,
xhtml,
xml,
...) and the special Konstrukt tags,
which put data from the plugins into your template.</p>

<p>The data/content is usually stored in a database,
which will be accessed by the plugins.
Static content will be placed in template files.</p>

<p>This principle allows for better maintainance and division of work.
A programmer can focus on the code (plugins) and a web designer can focus on the markup (templates).</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s also possible to embed perl code into the templates (via the perl plugin) or print out markup from your plugin.
But this not recommended and avoided through the frameworks own plugins.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="3._Reuse_of_code/markup"
>3.
Reuse of code/markup</a></h2>

<p>The logic is encapsulated in plugins,
the markup in templates.
These can be reused within the web site or over several different web sites.
So generally you write once and use often.
This avoids redundancy and duplicate work.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="4._Clean_code"
>4.
Clean code</a></h2>

<p>At first,
the separation of code and markup will greatly improve the overall code quality.</p>

<p>But also internally there was a big focus on clean code.
All code is written in object oriented perl with strong modularization.
The code is heavily documented and commented (i&#39;d guess a code:documentation ratio of about 1:1) and &#34;obfuscated&#34; code is avoided where possible.
Very spare use of global variables,
constant use of &#34;strict&#34; and &#34;warnings&#34; pragmas.
Further development and enhancement should be easy.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="5._Speed"
>5.
Speed</a></h2>

<p>There is a very smart chache mechanism used in this framework.
The cache system will identify static parts of your web pages (static markup and plugins that don&#39;t generate dynamic content) and cache the document so that only the dynamic parts of a document will be executed on a request and not the whole document.
All static documents of course will be served directly without any further processing.
Additionally the atomic template components will be cached to speed up the use in all documents using them.</p>

<p>Caching is a basic concept within this framework with the goal not to calculate anything twice when it didn&#39;t change.
The downside of this is,
that a plugin developer hat to understand the caching system,
when she/he wants to develop high-performance plugins.
If speed is not important,
there are also simple interfaced where one doesn&#39;t have to care about caching.</p>

<p>The framework is designed to work in a mod_perl (version 1 and 2) environment which allows for further speed gains.
But there are also interfaces for CGI and for the execution from the command line.</p>
